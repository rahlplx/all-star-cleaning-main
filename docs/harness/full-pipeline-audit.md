| Area | Score | Status |

## CRITICAL FINDING: Contact Page 404

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**URL:** `/en/contact` → returns "Page Not Found"
**Impact:** All "GET A FREE QUOTE" buttons (homepage hero, nav, service pages, footer) link to a broken page
**Root Cause:** No `contact.astro` page file exists in `src/pages/[locale]/`
**Fix:** Create `src/pages/[locale]/contact.astro` with contact form, map, and business info

This is the **single most important fix** — the primary CTA across the entire site is broken.
